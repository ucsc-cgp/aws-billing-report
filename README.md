## Configuration

Specify the people who should receive the report in `recipients`. You can refer
to `recipients.example` to see how the file should look like - each recipient
should be separated in the file by a newline.

Specify the accounts to check in `accounts.csv`. Similar to `recipients`, you
can reference `accounts.csv.example` to see what the file should look like.
Each account should be specified on its own line, starting with the account
name then the account number, each separated by a comma.
